Project : Online Library System Team Members : 2110030351 , 2110030352, 2110030449 , 2110030201 Online Library Management System maintains the information about the books
present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued, library staff and all. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex
task. The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues and returns
and all other operations. This computerization of library helps to reduce the workload of management as most of the manual work is automated.
